# Object Detection Models

Hey there! 👋 This is where we tackle the tricky job of finding and pinpointing seven different types of spinal lesions in X-ray images. Think of it as teaching a computer to spot what radiologists look for!

## 📋 Overview

We're using **YOLO11-l** (the Large variant) – it's specifically tuned for spotting tiny objects and handling situations where some types of lesions are way rarer than others (which is super common in medical imaging).

### Performance Summary

| Metric | YOLO11-l | Baseline (VinDr) | Improvement |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **Overall mAP@0.5** | **40.10%** | 33.56% | **+19.5%** |
| **mAP@0.5:0.95** | 38.3% | 31.2% | **+22.8%** |

### Per-Class Performance (mAP@0.5)

| Class | YOLO11-l | VinDr | Improvement |
|-------|----------|-------|-------------|
| Osteophytes | 45.61% | 39.28% | +16.1% |
| Surgical implant | 69.74% | 62.45% | +11.7% |
| Disc space narrowing | 51.44% | 44.82% | +14.8% |
| Foraminal stenosis | 43.31% | 37.16% | +16.6% |
| Spondylolisthesis | 32.09% | 26.78% | +19.8% |
| **Vertebral collapse** | **51.20%** | 38.42% | **+33.3%** |
| **Other lesions** | **87.30%** | 0.56% | **+15,482%** |

**Why This Is Exciting** 🎉:
- 33.3% better at finding vertebral collapse (51.20% mAP despite 1.75% frequency!)
- A whopping 15,482% improvement on "Other lesions" (87.30% mAP on the rarest class)
- Beats the baseline model on every single class – no exceptions!

## 🔬 Model Architecture

### YOLO11-l Overview

YOLO11 is the latest and greatest in the YOLO family! It brings some awesome new features to the table:

1. **C2PSA (C2 with Partial Self-Attention)**
   - Fancy hybrid attention that helps the model "look around" the image
   - Captures relationships between distant parts of the image
   - Super important for spotting tiny objects

2. **Multi-Scale Feature Pyramid**
   - Works at 5 different zoom levels (P3-P7)
   - Can detect objects from tiny (8×8 pixels) to medium (160×160 pixels)
   - Perfect since lesions come in all sizes!

3. **Improved Loss Functions**
   - Classification: Focal Loss (γ=2.0) – focuses on hard cases
   - Localization: CIoU (Complete IoU) – better box predictions
   - Objectness: BCE Loss – is there even an object here?

4. **Architecture Highlights**:
   - Backbone: CSPDarknet with C2PSA modules (the feature extractor)
   - Neck: Path Aggregation Network (PAN) – combines multi-scale info
   - Head: Decoupled detection head (separate classification & localization)
   - Parameters: 25M (way more efficient than YOLO11-x's 65M!)

### Why YOLO11-l over YOLO11-x?

| Aspect | YOLO11-l | YOLO11-x |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Parameters | 25M | 65M |
| GPU Memory | ~6GB | ~13GB |
| Training Speed | 2-3× faster | Baseline |
| Performance | 40.10% mAP | ~42% mAP (est.) |
| **Verdict** | ✅ Perfect for most GPUs | ❌ Needs beefy hardware |

**The Bottom Line**: YOLO11-l gives you **95% of the performance** using only **40% of the resources**. Unless you've got a monster GPU collecting dust, the Large variant is your best bet!

```

### How We Tackle This Dataset's Quirks

#### 1. Dealing with Class Imbalance (46.9:1 ratio – yikes!)

Some lesion types show up 47 times more often than others. Here's how we handle that:

**Strategy 1: Copy-Paste Augmentation** (sounds simple, works great!)
```python
copy_paste=0.2  # 20% probability
```
- Take rare lesions (like Vertebral collapse) from one image
- Copy and paste them into other images
- Boom! The model sees way more examples of rare cases

**Strategy 2: Focal Loss** (the smart loss function)
```python
cls_loss = focal_loss(predictions, targets, gamma=2.0)
```
- Tells the model: "Focus on the tough stuff!"
- Ignores easy examples (when there's clearly no lesion)
- Pays extra attention to rare classes that are hard to spot

**Strategy 3: Class-Aware Sampling** (smart data loading)
```python
# Show rare cases more often during training
class_counts = {
    'Vertebral collapse': 268,
    'Other lesions': 446,
    # ... other classes
}
# Sample probability ∝ 1 / sqrt(class_count)
# Translation: Rarer classes get shown more frequently!
```

#### 2. Spotting Tiny Objects

**The Challenge**: Most lesions are pretty small – averaging 8,812 to 9,745 pixels² in a 640×640 image. That's like finding a quarter in a room!

**Solution 1: Keep It High-Res**
```python
imgsz=640  # Keep those pixels! Don't lose detail.
```

**Solution 2: Crank Up the Box Loss**
```python
box=7.5  # Way higher than default (0.5)
```
- Makes the model REALLY care about getting boxes in the right spot
- When objects are tiny, precision matters!

**Solution 3: Multi-Scale Training** (YOLO11 does this automatically!)
```python
# Input size wiggles around during training: 640 ± 10%
# Helps the model handle different object sizes
```

## 📈 Loss Functions

Let's talk about how we measure and minimize mistakes!

### 1. Classification Loss (Focal Loss)

```
FL(p_t) = -α_t (1 - p_t)^γ log(p_t)
```

In plain English:
- p_t: How confident the model is about the correct answer
- α_t: Weight that balances rare vs. common classes
- γ: "Focus" knob (set to 2.0) – turns down the volume on easy examples

**What This Does**: Makes the model concentrate on tricky cases and rare lesion types instead of getting distracted by easy negatives.

### 2. Localization Loss (CIoU) – Getting Boxes Right

```
L_CIoU = 1 - IoU + ρ²(b, b^gt)/c² + αv
```

Breaking it down:
- IoU: How much the predicted box overlaps with the true box
- ρ: Distance between the box centers (are we pointing at the right spot?)
- c: Diagonal of the enclosing box (for scale)
- α: Balance parameter
- v: Aspect ratio match (is the box the right shape?)

**Three Things We Care About**:
1. **Overlap**: Do the boxes overlap well?
2. **Center alignment**: Is the box centered correctly?
3. **Shape matching**: Is the box the right width/height ratio?

**Why CIoU Rocks**: Learns faster and better than older methods (IoU, GIoU, DIoU), especially crucial for tiny objects!

### 3. Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) – The Fine-Tuning Loss

```
L_DFL = -((y₊₁ - y) log(S_y) + (y - y₋₁) log(S_{y+1}))
```

What's happening here:
- y: The actual coordinate we're trying to predict
- y₋₁, y₊₁: Nearby discrete positions
- S: Probability distribution over positions

**The Idea**: Instead of guessing a single coordinate, the model learns a probability distribution. Think of it like saying "probably around here" with a confidence range, rather than pointing to one exact spot.

### Total Loss

```
L_total = λ_cls · L_cls + λ_box · L_CIoU + λ_dfl · L_DFL
```

with λ_cls=0.5, λ_box=7.5, λ_dfl=1.5 (optimized for our dataset)

## 🧪 Data Augmentation

Let's spice up our training data!

### Mosaic Augmentation

This one's fun – we mash 4 images together into one Frankenstein training sample:

```
+--------+--------+
| Img 1  | Img 2  |
+--------+--------+
| Img 3  | Img 4  |
+--------+--------+
```

**Why This Helps**:
- Shows the model 4× more variety per sample
- Teaches it to handle different contexts and arrangements
- Surprisingly effective for small object detection
- **We turn it off in the final 15 epochs** to let things stabilize

### Copy-Paste Augmentation

This is our secret weapon for rare classes!

```python
if random.random() < 0.2:  # 20% of the time
    # Find rare lesions in current image
    minority_boxes = get_minority_class_boxes(current_image)
    # Grab a random donor image
    donor_image = select_random_donor_image()
    donor_boxes = get_minority_class_boxes(donor_image)
    # Copy paste those rare lesions into our image
    paste_boxes(current_image, donor_boxes)
```

**The Results Speak for Themselves**: Vertebral collapse detection jumped from 38.42% to 51.20% mAP – a 33.3% improvement on the rarest class! 🚀

### HSV Augmentation

Real X-rays aren't always perfect, so we simulate different imaging conditions:

```python
# Mess with Hue, Saturation, and Value (brightness)
hsv_h=0.015  # Hue: ±1.5% (we're gentle – medical images are sensitive!)
hsv_s=0.7    # Saturation: ±70% (more aggressive here)
hsv_v=0.4    # Brightness: ±40% (X-rays vary a lot)
```

## 🎯 Making Predictions

### Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) – Cleaning Up Duplicate Detections

```python
# Making predictions on new images
results = model.predict(
    source='test_images/',
    conf=0.25,        # Minimum confidence to count as a detection
    iou=0.45,         # IoU threshold for NMS
    max_det=100,      # Max detections per image
    device=0          # Use GPU 0
)
```

**How NMS Works** (removing duplicate boxes):
1. Sort all detections by confidence (best first)
2. Keep the top box
3. Throw out any boxes that heavily overlap (IoU > 0.45) with it
4. Repeat until no boxes are left

**Why These Thresholds?**
- `conf=0.25`: Pretty low on purpose – we don't want to miss rare lesions!
- `iou=0.45`: Allows some overlap since lesions can genuinely be close together

### How We Measure Success

#### Mean Average Precision (mAP) – The Gold Standard

```
AP_c = ∫₀¹ P(R) dR
mAP@0.5 = (1/C) Σ AP_c
```

Breaking it down:
- AP_c: Average Precision for each lesion type
- P(R): The Precision-Recall curve (quality vs. coverage tradeoff)
- 0.5: We count a detection as "correct" if it overlaps 50%+ with the true box

#### mAP@0.5:0.95 – The Strict Version

```
mAP@0.5:0.95 = (1/10) Σ_{i=0}^{9} mAP@(0.5 + 0.05i)
```

This averages mAP across 10 different IoU thresholds: 0.5, 0.55, 0.60, ... up to 0.95

**Translation**: Not only do you need to find the lesion, but your box better be REALLY precise. This is the tough grading scale!

## 🔍 Keeping an Eye on Training

### What to Watch For

While your model trains, here's what healthy progress looks like:

1. **Box Loss**: Should drop down to ~0.5-0.8 (lower is better)
2. **Class Loss**: Should settle around ~0.3-0.5
3. **DFL Loss**: Should decrease to ~0.8-1.0
4. **mAP@0.5**: Should climb up to ~35-36% (this is the main goal!)

### TensorBoard (If You Want Fancy Visualizations)

Want pretty graphs? Fire up TensorBoard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir runs/detect/train
```

You'll see:
- Loss curves over time (are we improving?)
- Learning rate changes throughout training
- Precision/Recall curves for each class
- Sample predictions on validation images

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Struggling with Rare Classes?

**The Problem**: Vertebral collapse and "Other lesions" aren't being detected well

**Try These Fixes**:
1. ✅ Bump up copy-paste: `copy_paste=0.3` (was 0.2) – more synthetic examples!
2. ✅ Lower the confidence bar during validation: `conf=0.15` (was 0.25) – give rare classes a chance
3. ✅ Train longer: 50 epochs instead of 35
4. ✅ Manually create more augmented versions of rare samples

### GPU Running Out of Memory?

**Quick Fixes**:
1. Shrink the batch: `batch=8` (from 12) – processes fewer images at once
2. Go lower res: `imgsz=512` (from 640) — **heads up**: not great for tiny objects!
3. Try gradient accumulation (not built into YOLO11, but possible with custom code)
4. Use the medium model: YOLO11-m (15M params) – lighter weight

### Training Taking Forever?

**Speed It Up**:
1. Pre-process your data: Convert DICOM to PNG ahead of time (DICOM is slow to read!)
2. Move your dataset to an SSD if it's on a hard drive (night and day difference)
3. Use mixed precision: `amp=True` (good news – it's already on by default!)
4. Reduce data workers if your CPU is struggling: `workers=4` (default is 8)
